# Movie Recommender
This project involved using Neural Collaborative Filtering to provide accurate movie recommendations for users, based off https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/ (the small sized dataset).
This was our final project for Intro to Data Science; it was published with the permission of my group members.
